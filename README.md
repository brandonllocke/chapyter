# Chapyter

Chapyter is a CLI application written in Python to record your reading, and
provide data about your reading.

Eventual goals for the software is to provide:
- [ ] Add books by title and author
- [ ] Automatically pull necessary information (ISBN, page count, etc.) via openlibrary API
- [ ] Mark start and end dates for books
- [ ] Display reading stats including:
   - [ ] Pages per [day/week/month/year/user-defined period]
   - [ ] Books per [day/week/month/year/user-defined period]

As of now, this is an incomplete project that is still being worked on.
